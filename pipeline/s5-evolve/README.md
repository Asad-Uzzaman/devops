# 5- Evolve

You have reached an initial version of a deployment pipeline that covers the fundamental steps.
You have reached this state following an incremental approach. That means that, from now on, you have to work continuously to improve the deployment pipeline. 

Next, some points to be considered for improving the pipeline are given. 

* Automate: reduce the required manual actions. 

* Cycle-time: measure the time spent on each stage to see exactly how long does the entire pipeline takes to run. This allows you to find out the pipeline's bottlenecks and solve them in order of priority.
